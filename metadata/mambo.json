 "description": "Mambo The Kitten is a community token inspired by a real kitten named Mambo, born 25 August 2025. Her name comes from the M marking on her head, being our fifth kitten (Mambo No.5), and her two Rambo-like war stripes. The token, launched on her 2-month birthday, explores the Kaspa ecosystem through creativity, transparency, and community rewards for loyal subscribers and supporters.",
